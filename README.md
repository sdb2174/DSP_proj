## Digital Signal Processing Course Project

There are several steps to running the project. First, if you would like to create some some '.png' images that we used in our testing data, you need to navigate to kaggle to download the dataset, as it is too large to put on here:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification

If the grader would like verification as to what data we used for generating the spectrograms (the three second audio clips), please contact me: sdb2174@columbia.edu
These clips to submit would be 2+ GB.

The images were generated using MS_save.m

There is a demo of producing the spectrograms in MS_demo.m

The main driver file for the machine learning process is in main_updated.ipynb . This jupyter notebook shows the '.png' files being imported, and the algorithm training on them.
